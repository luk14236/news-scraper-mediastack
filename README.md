# News Scraper using MediaStack API

## Description
This repository contains a Python script to scrape news articles using the MediaStack API. The script makes an HTTP request to the API, specifying keywords, date, and other relevant parameters, and returns the results in JSON format. This script can be useful for monitoring news and events related to a specific topic or keyword.

## Usage Instructions
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Replace `[api-key]` in the `key` variable with your own MediaStack API token.
3. Run the `search_news.ipynb` script in a Python environment compatible with Jupyter Notebook.
4. Visualize and analyze the obtained results.
